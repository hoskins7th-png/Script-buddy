Q: I’m selling FSBO to save money.
R: I get it—you want to keep more of your proceeds. FSBOs often “save” commission but lose more in price cuts because buyers can’t picture the payment; I add clear financing options so you keep price and keep profit. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: I already have buyers interested.
R: Interest isn’t approval. About 40% of “done deals” die late over financing; I verify your buyers in 24 hours so you don’t waste 30–45 days restarting. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: Buyers get their own financing—why do I need you?
R: Most walk away from homes they actually can afford because they can’t see the monthly. I show 2–3 payment paths (e.g., 2-1 buydown, FHA), and interest turns into offers. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: I don’t want to pay extra fees.
R: You don’t—buyers pay me when the loan closes. You get pre-qualified showings and faster closings at zero cost to you. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: I already work with a lender.
R: Keep them. I’m your Plan B for edge cases—self-employed buyers, non-QM, portfolio loans, non-warrantable condos—so good buyers don’t get turned away. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: I don’t have time for this.
R: Then you need me. I pre-screen so you do fewer showings with only qualified buyers—less chaos, more offers. Setup takes about 10 minutes. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: I don’t want agents or brokers involved.
R: You stay in control—I don’t list your home. I’m the financing guardrail that keeps your “yes” from falling apart at underwriting. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: My price is already sharp—I’ll sell without help.
R: Price isn’t the usual blocker—payment clarity is. Show the monthly with options and you unlock full-price offers without cutting. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: I’ll list with an agent soon if FSBO doesn’t work.
R: Smart backup. Before you pay 5–6%, let’s eliminate the financing barrier in 2–3 weeks so you know if price or presentation is really the issue. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: Buyers told me they’re pre-approved.
R: Pre-approved isn’t approved for your property. HOA rules, appraisal gaps, and DTI shifts kill deals late—I verify fit for your home now. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: I’ve sold homes before—I know what I’m doing.
R: Totally. What’s changed is financing: buydowns, non-QM, portfolio programs. I add tools most lenders don’t present, and you sell faster. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: I don’t want to hand over my buyers’ info.
R: Don’t. I give you a one-page affordability sheet; you hand it out, and buyers contact me if they want options. You stay in control. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: This sounds too good to be true—what’s the catch?
R: No catch. I’m paid when buyers close their loans. Your success is literally how I get paid—no fees from you, no fine print. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: If I need to, I’ll just lower the price.
R: Most FSBOs cut price when the real issue is payment confusion. Clarity beats discounting—don’t leave $15–20K on the table for nothing. 
FSBO Objection Handling & Role-…
Q: Buyers only care about getting a deal, not loan options.
R: Data says 73% walk away from homes they love due to affordability uncertainty. Show them a $/mo they can handle and “maybe” becomes “offer.”
Q: Why should I list with you?
R: I’m both a licensed real estate broker AND a mortgage loan officer, so I fix the financing gap that killed your first listing and convert showings into real offers. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: I’m already relisting with my agent.
R: Loyalty is fine—but if the plan is the same (wait and drop price), you’ll get the same result; I relaunch with payment scenarios that make buyers act. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: I’m taking a break from selling.
R: Breaks don’t stop carrying costs; let me show you exactly why it didn’t sell and a 30-day fix so you don’t burn another $2–3K/month. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: The market is bad—nothing sells.
R: Homes near you are selling in 30–45 days; it wasn’t “the market,” it was missing affordability clarity—my specialty. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: I already dropped the price twice—I’m done.
R: Good—stop dropping; I show 2–3 financing paths (e.g., 2-1 buydown, FHA, conventional) so buyers pay your price with confidence. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: My home is fine; the agent was the problem.
R: Probably the strategy was; perfect photos don’t close buyers who can’t see the payment—finance-first positioning does. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: I don’t want another broker.
R: I’m not “another broker”—I’m broker + lender; I control marketing AND financing so deals don’t die at underwriting. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: I’ll just rent it out.
R: That’s a band-aid with tenant risk and management costs; I’d rather sell in 30–45 days and free your cash without landlord drama. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: I can’t afford another commission.
R: You’re already paying $2–3K/month to wait; a fast, financed sale often nets more than months of carry hoping to save a fee. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: I need to think about it.
R: Think with data, not guesswork—let me send a free breakdown of what blocked the sale and the exact fix, then decide. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: Buyers just aren’t out there.
R: They are—your showings proved it; they left without offering because they couldn’t map the monthly; I solve that on-page and in-person. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: I’m waiting for spring.
R: Spring brings more buyers—and 2x the competing listings; selling now with financing clarity often beats waiting and paying carry. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: My agent says “be patient.”
R: “Be patient” isn’t a plan; a new strategy is—finance-forward relaunch with pre-qualified buyers and payment options. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: Lenders always blow up my deals.
R: That’s why I pre-qualify before offers and quarterback the loan myself; fewer surprises, faster closings. 
EXPIRED LISTING SELLERS OBJECTI…
Q: How does a mortgage broker help me sell?
R: Price is a number; payment is a feeling—when I show buyers exactly how they can afford your home, hesitation turns into offers.
